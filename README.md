Goal of Patterns:
- Shared vocabulary with concrete qualities, characteristics, and constraints that the pattern represents.
- Say more with less.
- Reduce misunderstanding.
- Stay in design lingo longer - don't need to dive down in the nitty-gritty if there is a shared understanding of the pattern.
- Encourage more junior developers to be motivated to learn patterns.

Don't get pattern fever - apply them when they will _actually save you time_. Consider the points above as well when considering time - not just raw development time.

Conventions:
- End the classes containing the pattern with the pattern name i.e. SwimStrategy.

These patterns were lifted from _Head First Design Patterns by Eric Freeman and Elizabeth Robson_
