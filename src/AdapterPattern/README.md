# Adapter Pattern

- Real life example: The three-pronged US wall socket and the UK wall socket. You have to buy an _adapter_ if you visit the UK or vice versa depending on where you start from.
- Useful when you have an old interface and a new interface and need to marry the two together.
- A good example is old code and new code, with the new code providing a refreshed implementation. You want to use a new interface going forward but need to provide a way for the old implementation to work still.
