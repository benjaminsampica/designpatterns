# Decorator Pattern

- Provides an easy way to add custom logic onto a superclass at runtime versus having to change code.
- Favors composition over inheritance.
- Even with this pattern, compared to subclassing all behavior, it's easy to still have class explosion and make it hard to follow. Use it wisely and turn to another pattern when your design needs it.
- Works really well alongside factory & builder patterns.

TODO: Add in factory/builder pattern integration.
